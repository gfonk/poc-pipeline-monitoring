# poc-pipeline-monitoring
POC to create a dashboard for Jenkins Pipelines

**The ideal:**
  - How to monitor Pipelines via jenkins

- Using 
  - http://grafana.org/ or https://graphiteapp.org/
  - Jenkins Pipelines

- To answer the questions:
  - What may be the bottlenecks?
  - What jobs are frequently failing?
  - Is it possible to alert a team based on 3 consecutive failures

- This could be tied to a CI server, github, or rally/jira
  - integrate: nexus server, sonarqube server, etc
  - Open, what other metrics would you like to see on a dashboard if you were a product owner, developer, or in quality?

- Intention: 
  - to remove the user away from Jenkins, and closer to the project to reveal more insightful information in one location
  - To minimize the tools of the average developer
  
  **Notes**
```
1. Using influxdb as a datastorage is eligible (no graphite as a backend and as result no creation of any custom Jenkins plugin from scratch (phew!))
2. As a result for short POC would be enough to send STATUS, DURATION and may be some more jobâ€™s meta info into influxdb. Show it in Grafana would be great.
3. It may be done on some custom maven project, which could be shared with my github-id: eugeun
4. Thursday is a deadline for this short POC
```
